#### Project type
Is it a game or research-relevant?
#### Project description
* If it is a game, describe your game mechanics. It should include the core gameplay, win/lose condition, game control etc.
* If it is for research purpose, describe the topic and your research goal. Also list methods you will explore to achieve your goal.
    * For example, if you want to research different algorithms in achieving plausible game AI, you should at least list the following information: 
        * Algorithms you plan to explore in this project (i.e. I will research navmesh generation algorithms)
        * How to present these algorithms to your audience (i.e.  I will build a test game map with obstacles. I will show how AIs perform pathfindings from the same starting position to the same destination with different algorithms.)
